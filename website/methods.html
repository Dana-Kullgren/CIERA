            <p>

                I looked at a total of 33 star clusters which were simulated using the Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) code, a Hénon-type Monte Carlo code that computes the long-term evolution of stellar clusters (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4365/ab7919" target="_blank">Kremer et al. 2020b</a>). These 
                simulations all had the following initial conditions:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Galactocentric distance = 8 [kpc]</li>
                    <li>Total number of objects (N) = 8 × 10<sup>5</sup></li>
                    <li>Initial binary fraction = 5 [%]</li>
                    <li>High-mass binary fraction = 5 [%]</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                By contrast, these initial conditions were varied among the models:
            </p>    
                <ul>
                    <li>Virial radius = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 [pc]</li>
                    <li>Metallicity = 0.01, 0.1 [Z<sub>☉</sub>]</li>
                    <li>&alpha;<sub>3</sub> = 1.6, 2.0, 2.3, 2.6, and 3.0</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                The canonical value of &alpha;<sub>3</sub> is 2.3 so the values of &alpha;<sub>3</sub> used for these models were chosen around that value (<a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2001MNRAS.322..231K/doi:10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04022.x target="_blank">Kroupa 2001</a>).
                <br/><br/>
                From these simulations, I determined the rate of BBH mergers and the masses of BHs that collide in BBH mergers
                for each &alpha;<sub>3</sub> value. These variables from the simulation data were compared to data from the Laser 
                Interferometer
                Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which detects BBH mergers by observing gravitational waves. The LIGO data used in this analysis includes the 01, 02, and 03 observations (<a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/eventapi/html/GWTC/" target="_blank">LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA 
                2020</a>).
        <br/><br/>
            As in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2021ApJ...913L..29F/doi:10.3847/2041-8213/ac00a7" target="_blank">Fragione and Banerjee 2021</a>, I applied a detectability weight to each simulated BBH merger based on that
                merger’s signal-to-noise ratio.
        <br/><br/>
            By comparing the rates and component masses obtained from different &alpha;<sub>3</sub> values to rates and component masses in
            LIGO data, I aim to better constrain the IMF in stellar clusters.
