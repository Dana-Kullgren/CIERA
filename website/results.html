        <h2>Results</h2>
        
        <p>
            Figure 1 relates merger rates from simulations to observational data. It shows that simulation rates best match observational 
            rates for &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=1.6, &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=2.0, and &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=2.3.
            <br/><br/>
            Figure 2 has five different &alpha;<sub>3</sub> values. In a BBH merger, the primary mass is the mass of the larger BH. In this 
            plot, the simulation data for &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=2.0 and &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=2.3 match most closely with the observational 
            data.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Overall, the simulation data for &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=1.6, &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=2.0, and &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=2.3 match most closely with 
                the observational data.</b>
        </p>
        <h2>Discussion and Next Steps</h2>

        <p>
            This process has produced constraints for &alpha;<sub>3</sub>, but there are still steps to be taken before a definitive result 
            can be given.
            <br/><br/>            
            I will improve the accuracy of the constraints on &alpha;<sub>3</sub> by incorporating simulations of stellar environments 
            outside of clusters 
            into this analysis (simulations need to include BBHs from the field). The current simulations only look at BBHs formed in stellar 
            clusters while LIGO data is not limited to cluster BBHs.
            <br/><br/>            
            However, cluster simulations can still be used to put constraints on &alpha;<sub>3</sub> 
            if assumptions are made about the fraction of mergers that clusters contribute to the overall merger rate. For example, if I assume 
            that clusters contribute X% to the overall merger rate, I can calculate the overall merger rate compared to LIGO data. This 
            would allow me to put constraints on the number of top-heavy clusters in the Universe.
            <br/><br/>            
            As a separate note, this data indicates that clusters with top-light IMFs are unlikely to be large contributors to the overall merger rate.
            <br/><br/>            
            Another next step 
            for this project will be to produce an updated grid of simulation models and perform this analysis based on that grid. The 
            current models being used do not allow for three-body binary formation (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/1970ApJ...160..135M/doi:10.1086/150412" target="_blank">Mansbach 1970</a>). Furthermore, 
            the binary period 
            distributions and radii of giant stars need to be updated to remain consistent with recent data.
            
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Preliminary results show that &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=<b>1.6</b>, &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=<b>2.0</b>, and &alpha;<sub>3</sub>=<b>2.3</b> are the most 
            accurate &alpha;<sub>3</sub> values. This indicates that &alpha;<sub>3</sub> is slightly less than or equal to its canonical 
            value, which either means that the current understanding of the IMF is accurate (&alpha;<sub>3</sub>=2.3) or that there are a 
            greater number of massive stars formed in the universe than current theory suggests (&alpha;<sub>3</sub>=1.6, 2.0). With more work on 
            this project, I will put more accurate constraints on the value of &alpha;<sub>3</sub> in the IMF.
