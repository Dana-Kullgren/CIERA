        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         My name is Dana Kullgren and I am an undergraduate physics major at the University of Delaware. I plan to graduate in 2024 and go 
         on to study astrophysics in graduate school. Aside from physics, I like to play guitar, read books, make and admire art, and spend 
         time with my friends and family.
        <br/>
        <br/>
         This summer, I worked with Drs. Fred A. Rasio and Giacomo Fragione during the CIERA REU at Northwestern University. My project 
         focused on comparing simulated mergers of black holes to observed mergers in order to put constraints on the stellar initial 
         mass function (which determines the mass distribution of stars). To contact me about this project or anything else, feel free to 
         send me a message on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dana-kullgren" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
